    
    need to work on click a button and that button knows what parameter it is of.
    the generated button is not shown in hda type properties. so not sure if it can call hda modular script. 
    try to use exec() and a script in sparse parameter.
    callback command can be created when button is created. 
above solved

could not get folder of a parameter by parameter name?
could not find folder's label by folder's name?

find sop location. Done!
1. extracting number from button's name 
2.use the number as index to find correct element from sop list. 
3. sop list is output by findMoveCache.py.  
Additionally, changed the command for the button in insertParm.py
